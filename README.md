# Hey, it's CryptoAI Jedi

**Tech Support Specialist & Operations Manager** building toward Web3 infrastructure roles. 5+ years datacenter operations, node operator since 2021, blockchain user since 2018.

Currently: Operations Manager for ASIC mining hosting company (~2000 units)  
Looking for: Remote Tech Support II/III or Operations Analyst roles in blockchain, crypto, fintech, infrastructure or cybersecurity

## What I Work With

**Support & Troubleshooting:** Tier II/III escalations, Zendesk/Jira, 94% FCR  
**Infrastructure:** Linux sysadmin, datacenter ops, fleet management  
**Scripting:** PowerShell, Bash, log analysis automation  
**Blockchain:** Node operations (Bitcoin & Monero), DeFi protocols, wallet troubleshooting  
**Currently Learning:** SQL (transaction/log analysis), Python, Grafana/Prometheus

## Recent Projects

**[Solana Escrow Marketplace](https://github.com/CryptoAI-Jedi/solana-escrow-marketplace)** - Learning project building an escrow dApp on Solana testnet using Rust/Anchor to understand program architecture and security patterns. Currently implementing buyer-seller escrow logic with manual dispute resolution.

**[AI Blockchain Automation Agency](https://github.com/CryptoAI-Jedi/ai-blockchain-automation-agency)** - Side business building AI automation and blockchain solutions for healthcare inefficiencies. Early stage development.

## What I've Learned

**From node operations:** Troubleshooting RPC failures taught me to read logs systematically and correlate errors across services. Currently developing monitoring scripts to automate health checks and catch issues before downtime.

**From datacenter work:** Managing thousands of ASIC units means everything fails eventually. I've learned to prioritize tasks based upon impact, use various monitoring systems, and build runbooks for common issues.

**From crypto since 2018:** Regular use of DeFi, staking, multi-chain wallets & wallet security gives me real user context & deep familiarity with onchain flows. I understand the pain points customers face when troubleshooting transaction failures, stuck deposits, or RPC timeouts, along with the importance of operational security.
