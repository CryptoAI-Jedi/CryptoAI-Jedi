# Hi there, I'm CryptoAI Jedi ❖

### Technical Operations Lead | Bridging TradFi & DeFi Infrastructure

I am a **Technical Operations Specialist** with 15+ years of experience managing high-stakes environments—from **ASIC mining fleets (2,000+ units)** to **commodities trading desks**. I specialize in keeping infrastructure online, automating workflows, and translating complex technical issues for non-technical stakeholders.

- **Currently working on:** Automating ASIC health checks with Python & Grafana.
- **Core Competency:** I don't just fix hardware; I build the systems that prevent it from breaking.
- **Background:** Former Series 3 Commodities Broker turned Crypto Native (since 2018).
